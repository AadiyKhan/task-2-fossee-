# AI Debugging Assistant Prompt - Python Screening Task 2

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive solution for Python Screening Task 2: creating a prompt for an AI debugging assistant that helps students learn Python programming without revealing direct solutions.

##  Repository Contents

### Core Files

- **`AI_Debugging_Assistant_Prompt.md`** - The main prompt that instructs the AI how to behave
- **`Design_Choices_Explanation.md`** - Detailed explanation of design decisions and rationale
- **`Reasoning_Analysis.md`** - Answers to the required reasoning questions
- **`Example_Scenarios.md`** - Practical demonstrations of the prompt in action
- **`README.md`** - This file with setup instructions and overview

##  Prompt Objectives

The AI debugging assistant prompt is designed to:

1. **Guide Without Revealing**: Help students discover bugs through strategic questioning rather than direct answers
2. **Build Debugging Skills**: Teach systematic debugging techniques and problem-solving approaches
3. **Encourage Learning**: Maintain motivation through positive reinforcement and collaborative tone
4. **Adapt to Skill Levels**: Work effectively with both beginner and advanced Python learners
5. **Develop Independence**: Foster critical thinking and self-reliance in problem-solving

##  Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- No special software required
- The prompt works with any AI language model (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
- Text editor for viewing files (any will work)

### Usage Instructions

1. **Clone or Download** this repository
2. **Read the main prompt** in `AI_Debugging_Assistant_Prompt.md`
3. **Copy the prompt** and paste it into your AI assistant interface
4. **Present student code** along with their question to the AI
5. **Review the response** to ensure it follows the guidance principles

### Testing the Prompt

You can test the prompt effectiveness by:

1. **Using the example scenarios** provided in `Example_Scenarios.md`
2. **Creating your own buggy code** samples
3. **Evaluating responses** against the criteria:
   - Does it avoid giving direct solutions?
   - Does it ask guiding questions?
   - Does it maintain an encouraging tone?
   - Does it teach debugging skills?

## Submission Checklist

-  **Prompt is clear, specific, and well-structured**
  - Main prompt provides comprehensive instructions for AI behavior
  - Clear guidelines on what to do and what to avoid
  - Structured response framework included

-  **Reasoning is thoughtful and well-articulated**
  - Design choices explained with educational psychology principles
  - Specific examples of implementation strategies
  - Adaptation strategies for different skill levels provided

-  **Includes reasoning answers**
  - Tone and style recommendations with examples
  - Balance strategy between bug identification and student guidance
  - Detailed adaptation approaches for beginner vs. advanced learners

##  Key Design Principles

### Educational Approach
- **Socratic Method**: Uses strategic questioning to guide discovery
- **Constructive Feedback**: Begins with positive reinforcement
- **Incremental Learning**: Addresses one issue at a time to prevent overwhelm
- **Skill Development**: Focuses on teaching debugging process, not just fixing code

### Communication Strategy
- **Encouraging Tone**: Maintains motivation through supportive language
- **Clear Language**: Uses beginner-friendly terms while avoiding condescension
- **Structured Responses**: Consistent format for predictable, helpful interactions
- **Collaborative Approach**: Positions AI as learning partner, not authority figure

### Adaptive Features
- **Skill Level Recognition**: Adjusts guidance based on code complexity and student communication
- **Flexible Vocabulary**: Scales technical terminology appropriately
- **Variable Scaffolding**: Provides more or less support based on demonstrated ability
- **Universal Principles**: Maintains core educational values across all interactions

## How to Use This Repository
